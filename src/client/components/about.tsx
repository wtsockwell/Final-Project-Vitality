                                        The term "<b>heart disease</b>" refers to several types of heart conditions. The most
                                        common type of heart disease in the United States is <b>coronary artery disease </b> 
                                        (<b>CAD</b>), which affects the blood flow to the heart. Decreased blood flow can cause
                                        a heart attack.

                                        Sometimes heart disease may be "silent" and not diagnosed until a person
                                        experiences signs or symptoms of a <b>heart attack</b>, <b>heart failure</b>, or an

                                        <b>High blood pressure</b>, <b>high blood cholesterol</b> and <b>smoking</b> are key risk factors

                                        Indians or Alaska Natives, Hispanics, and whites. For Asian American or
                                        Pacific Islander men, heart disease is second only to cancer.

                                        For Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander women, heart disease is second

                                        Know your blood pressure. Having uncontrolled blood pressure can result in
                                        heart disease. High blood pressure has no symptoms so it's important to have

                                        diabetes. Having diabetes raises your risk of heart disease.
